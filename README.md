# Implementation-of-Linear-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Start the program
2. Import the numpy.pandas and matplotlib
3. Read the file which store the data
4. Declare x as hours and y as scores of the data
5. Using loop predit the data and find the y-intercept, slope using the formulae.
6. Find the best fit using the straight line formula
7. Display the data in graph using the matplotlib libraries
8. Stop the Program. 

## Program:
```
/*
Program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent.
Developed by: S Saichandran
RegisterNumber:  212220040138
*/
```

## Output:
![linear regression using gradient descent](GD1.png)
![linear regression using gradient descent](GD2.png)

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the linear regression using gradient descent is written and verified using python programming.
